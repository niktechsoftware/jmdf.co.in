<b>Due to priority given to women members by self-help groups</b><br><br>
In our country, many NGOs and Micro Finance Institutions function with the aim of reducing poverty by setting up and providing self-help groups. Apart from making women self-reliant, these groups are also playing a role in the development of overall awareness, which is taking their social, economic and personal empowerment. However, the lofty goal of micro finance is poverty alleviation, but the goal of empowering women as its important supplement is also being fulfilled. The following reasons for the active presence of women in the micro finance sector are:<br><br>
The contribution of women in any economy is not often noticed, which is also enclosed in the Indian economy. This is the reason that micro finance institutions give credit to women and their development. In this way Micro Finance Institutions are playing an important role in the creation, development and promotion of women enterprises by giving loans to women. There has been an increase in women's autonomy, independence, self-reliance, self-employment, confidence and social status.<br><br>
According to an estimate, 70 percent of the world's poorest population is women. It is clear that poverty is more than women, compared to men. In this way, in order to achieve the goal of reducing poverty by micro-finance institutions, especially women self-help groups are encouraged. Because it is not certain to have a male influence out of the poverty line also affect his family, but economic empowerment of women certainly brings sweeping changes in the life of the whole family, especially the children.<br><br>
The aspect of empowerment of women in countries like India is more complex because women's presence is often in the informal area where not only equal pay is not given on equal work, but cases of sexual exploitation of women are also high.<br><br>
Women in developing countries have higher unemployment rates than men, in particular, women are being given special attention by micro finance institutions.<br><br>
Women are also given priority as a targeted class by the government because women have effective role in social change.<br><br>
Many studies have proven that women's financial reliability is higher than men because women are more responsible for the use of loan amount than men. The rate of loan taken by women from Micro Finance Institutions is more than 95 per cent, which is far more successful than male self-help groups operated by men. It is clear that women's groups are better customers than men, they are better managers of resources, spreading the benefits of loans among families.<br><br>
<b> Self-help groups influence women's lives</b><br><br>
Due to working in self-help groups, women's confidence, self-esteem, self-esteem, etc. increase as women collect small savings as a group outside the domestic periphery, take loans, contact bank employees, establish small enterprises By following the action of group meetings, the following capabilities are developed in women: -<br><br>
<b>The power of self-determination</b> - because of working as a member of the self-help group, the power of women's own decision-making is developed. By women, dealing with banks, paperwork, etc, self-confidence flourishes. Operations of the group's activities, participation in meetings develop the capacities of women's decision-making, which gradually gives voice to their thinking in the family and community.<br><br>
<b>Information and availability of resources</b> - As a member of the group, women's mobility increases. Women in captivity in the wall of the house come in contact with Panchayat institutions, banks, government machinery, NGOs, micro finance institutions, etc. through these groups, so that they have more information and resources. The availability of information and resources empowers women.<br><br>
The ability to keep their point in the matter of collective decision- Studies have shown that women working in self-help groups participate in community work, attendance at panchayat meetings are more active. These women are more likely to keep their point in front of the community than other women.<br><br>
<b>Financial self-sufficiency</b> - As a member of self-help group, women become financially self-reliant, which improve their position in the family and thus utilize the available funds in their personal use or education and health of children. . Studies have clearly shown that cases of domestic violence are reduced with financially self-reliant women.<br><br>
<b>Psychological Development</b> - As a member of Self Help Group, women are sure to participate in social initiatives on their own initiative. The belief in their ability to make changes is reinforced.<br><br>
<b>Skill Development</b> - In our country, women often do many things like stitching, embroidery, papad making, pickle, but these works are done on a large scale commercial basis through self help groups. These groups are also given skill training by the government and non-government organizations, so that they can learn skills to improve their own individual or collective power.
