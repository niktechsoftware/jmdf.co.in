<h3>How to Make Cake Gel – Small Manufacturing Project</h3>
Cake Gel is mainly used by the cake manufacturer in making cakes. It is a cake improver, comprised of emulsifiers and humectants, which greatly improves volume through increased aeration and provides a more uniform crumb structure. It also improves softness in a cake.<br><br>
Additionally, cake gel increases stability and reduces variances that may be caused due to changing flour quantity and changing process parameters.<br><br>
If you are looking forward to start a low-cost small home-based manufacturing business in the  Food industry, cake gel is a product you can consider. a small
What is Cake Gel Made Of?<br><br>
Cake gels are semi-liquid made up of water, emulsifiers, solvents, and sugar. Raw materials like vegetable oil, G.M.S., Xanthene’s gum, Satiric Acid etc are basic ingredients. It is stable (at room temperature) gel-like product.<br><br>
The cake gel making project requires a mixing machine, heating equipment, packing machine for manufacturing the product. This helps in improving the cake quality after baking. The product is in high demand in the domestic market and also worldwide.<br><br>
In cake gel making business, one needs to concentrate on optimizing process flow, delivering market-relevant innovations, shortening market response times and attain higher success rates with development projects.<br><br>
Things to consider while Making Cake Gel<br><br>
While making cake gel, you need to consider the following;<br><br>
1.	Choice of emulsifier<br>
2.	Raw material properties<br>
3.	Recipe (ingredient ratio)<br>
4.	Blending technology<br>
5.	Processing time<br>
6.	Temperature control<br>
7.	Equipment<br>
By understanding and controlling these parameters, you can produce a cake gel with the desired shelf-life and functionality.<br><br>
While making cake gel, you will need to aim to create a uniform distribution of right-sized, stabilized air bubbles or ‘holes’ throughout the cake. And to achieve this, you will need to create a system that keeps emulsifiers in α-formed crystals as long as possible.<br><br>
This type of cake gel will continue to work its magic at every stage of the production process, and its softening effects will last for many months.<br><br>
